# AI Agent â€“ Profile Lookup & Summary

##  Description
This project implements an **AI Agent** that, given a specified username (and optionally a keyword), will:
1. **Search the internet** using an LLM-powered agent to find the matching profile URL.
2. If multiple similar usernames appear, **the first match** will be returned.  
   > ðŸ’¡ For better accuracy, include a keyword in your query that appears in the profileâ€™s description.
3. **Scrape the found URL** to retrieve profile data.  
   *(Currently this uses a mock static file because LinkedInâ€™s API is paid and no free alternative was found.)*
4. **Generate a short summary** of the person.
5. **Provide two interesting facts** about them.
